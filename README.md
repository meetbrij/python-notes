# Python Programming for Data Science and Machine Learning

Welcome to my page on learning python for machine learning.

I am currently learning python for data science and machine learning from various sources like dataquest.io and Udemy courses. I am an experienced Software Engineer so the notes below would not be helpful to someone who is an absolute beginner. To understand the notes below one should be familiar with basic programming concepts like variables, operators, loops, conditionals, arrays, lists and functions.

The notes below would be helpful for someone who has experience in writing code using programming language like Javascript, Java, C, Ruby etc.

1. [Basic Python Programming](docs/basics.md)
2. [Python for Data Analysis and Visualization](#)
3. [SQL Fundamentals and Web Scraping](#)
4. [Statistics and Probability](#)
5. [Machine Learning with Python](#)
6. [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](#)
7. [Working with Spark](#)
8. [Working with TensorFlow and Keras](#)
